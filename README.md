# Grid Filler

Grid Filler is a 2D-grid puzzle editor.

This project is a work in progress. The following features still need to be added:

- Relative content styles tools (e.g. position, font size)
- Toggle content style tools (e.g. bold/italic)
- Version numbers for migrations in grid serialization
- Cell copy and pasting
- Puzzle type templates
- Arrow key cell navigation
- Better styling for content input
- Throttle and limit events in undo history
- Save state in localstorage
- Appropriate cursor behavior
