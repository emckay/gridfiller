# Grid Filler

Grid Filler is a 2D-grid puzzle editor.

This project is a Work In Progress. The following features still need to be added:

- Relative content styles tools (e.g. position, font size)
- Toggle content style tools (e.g. bold/italic)
- Version numbers for migrations in grid serialization
- Cell copy and pasting
- Puzzle type templates
